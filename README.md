# yod (`/jod/`) - the procedural constructed language generator

**yod** is a library which will procedurally generate a constructed language based on
various rules which can be supplied by the user, or a completely random language if no
rules are specified. **yod** handles everything from phoneme inventory, to phonotactics
to syllable structure, to creating a lexicon, to generating grammatically sound sentences.

The source code for **yod** can be found at http://github.com/Cesque/yod/

My thesis, *"Creating a library to aid in
constructed language generation"*, which explains the development and purpose of **yod**, can be found [here](https://github.com/Cesque/yod/raw/master/report/report.pdf).
